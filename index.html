                During my first year of college, many moons ago, I took a coding class for one semester. Since then, my career and education have taken me many different directions. However, coding is very different from my one semester back in the last 90s. So, I am
                very excited to gain experience in developing new skills to become a great web developer like B.A.Cas!

                I grew up in the small town of Helper, Utah, where I attended what is now Utah State University Eastern. I grew up and moved on. I recently graduated from Washington State University with a master's. I thought, why not add to my collection of Universities
                I've attended.

                Besides going to school, I'm a busy mom of three, run a veterinary clinic, and serve in the schools and community. I'm the local Chamber of Commerce president, PTA Past President and Head Room Parent for my two boys classrooms.
